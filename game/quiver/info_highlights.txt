Quiver Fortress:

Highlights:
- Powered by the BDS (Bitl Development Studio) Base fork of the Source SDK, which implements item whitelisting, animated avatar support, legacy viewmodels, Discord RPC, the implementation of over 200+ community-made pull requests from the official Source SDK repo, and more.
- Faster paced than based TF2. Run speed on all classes has been increased, and all classes have the ability to bunny hop (up to 2x their normal move speed). Each class has different air speed caps and bunnyhop speed boosts, making each class feel unique to play. Stun has also been removed, making movement more consistent in active combat.
- Added Armor, a damage resistance layer that protects each class. How strong the armor is depends on each class.
- Legacy menu and legacy weapon viewmodels have been restored.
- The weapon list has been curated to fit the faster playstyle. Weapon reskins of stock weapons are allowed, alongside normal and reskin versions of some unlocks (see info_whitelist.txt).
- Some unlockable weapons have been rebalanced to fit the faster pace of combat and the new gameplay mechanics.
- Added several custom weapons, inspired by new and old concepts. These custom weapons were made to add new and more inventive ways to play your favorite classes
- Bots now equip items, will actively look out for armor (on higher difficulties) and have random difficulties, giving a more dynamic single-player experience.
- Added Team Deathmatch. Maps without a specified gamemode (no gamemode logic or entities), or with dm_ or tdm_ prefixes will be considered Team Deathmatch maps. Disable qf_allow_tdm if you wish to disable Team Deathmatch on your server and restore the original "no gamemode" logic.
	- Maps include: 2Fort, Lumberyard, Ravine.
- Disabled the Match Status HUD, and restored the original TF2 round timer.
- Disabled stun in most instances, except in MvM where it's crucial against robots.
- Disabled player glows on spawn and spectator (except in MvM).
- Disabled cosmetics, as newer cosmetics added to the base TF2 harm team recognition, alongside performance problems. However, cosmetic weapons (australiums, stranges, etc) and reskins are allowed.
- Whitelisted weapons are now given to players even if they don't own them, allowing each player to be on an equal playing field.
- Implemented NeoDement's Missing Killicons Pack.

Class changes:
- Run speeds have been increased across all 9 classes. However, one aspect remains: Heavies are the slowest, Scouts are the fastest.
- Source 2006-styled bunnyhopping is enabled. All classes have different bunnyhopping speed boosts, with Heavy having the lowest and Scout having the highest. Bunnyhopping is capped to 2x of the class's base move speed.
- Added increased air control to all classes. Each class has a different amount of air control.
- Armor has been added as an additional layer of damage resistance. How strong it is depends on the class. Armor can also be penetrated by backstabs, taunt kills, and headshots, and won't protect against bleed damage. Armor can be repaired by Dispensers, resupply cabinets, or by friendly Engineers hitting you with their wrench. Armor can also be picked up from Ammo crates.
	- If your Armor breaks, you'll be given mini-crits for 3 seconds to give you a chance to kill the responsible party. Medics with broken armor healing a teammate will share the mini crit bonus with their healing target. This bonus does NOT apply if your armor was broken through fall damage or self damage. When the bonus applies, you'll also be marked for death for 3.5 seconds. In addition, the game will slightly heal you 10 health per second over 3 seconds (up to 30 health), giving players a small health bonus for hiding in cover during the aftermath of their shield breaking, and rewarding enemies who choose to attack quickly with a faster time to kill. The healing effect doesn't transfer over to your heal patient.
	- Spies who are cloaked will not show the armor break effect when cloaked, but the sound will still play.
- Spies can now "fake" a reload by disguising and pressing the reload key with a full clip.

Custom Weapons:
- Heavy gets a minigun to go alongside his regular one, known as the Artillery Cannon. It is fires powerful, accurate rounds at the expense of bullet count and fire rate.
- The Sniper has an alternative Sniper Rifle called the Railgun, allowing the Sniper to fire charged shots without zooming and penetrate through multiple targets at the expense of armor durability.
- The Engineer has an alternative PDA called the Valkyrie 3S, which increases your sentry turn rate in return for your buildings' maximum health.
- Heavy gets another minigun, called the Ludmila, which increases the Heavy's survivability in exchange for damage and minigun spinup time.
- The Soldier gets a melee that's a blast from the past, The Vitality Glitch, which increases the damage and move speed of the user when on low health, in return for damage, move speed, and armor durability.
- The Medic gets a new Medigun called the Überrüstungsheiler that heals armor on top of health. Its ÜberCharge fully repairs armor and makes it unbreakable.
- Demoknights have a new shield called The Sun-Jumper, which allows increased armor durability and the ability to jump while charging, at the cost of his charge, his armor's repair rate, and his max armor.
