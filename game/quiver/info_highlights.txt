Quiver Fortress:

Hightlights:
- Powered by the BDS (Bitl Development Studio) Base fork of the Source SDK, which implements item whitelisting, animated avatar support, legacy viewmodels, Discord RPC, the implementation of over 200+ community-made pull requests from the official Source SDK repo, and more.
- Faster paced than based TF2. Run speed on all classes has been increased, and all classes have the ability to bunny hop. Each class has different air speed caps and bunnyhop speed boosts, making each class feel unique to play.
- Added Armor, a damage resistance layer that protects each class. How strong the armor is depends on each class.
- Legacy menu and legacy weapon viewmodels have been restored.
- The weapon list has been curated to fit the faster playstyle. Weapon reskins of stock weapons are allowed, alongside normal and reskin versions of some unlocks (see info_whitelist.txt).
- Some unlockable weapons have been rebalanced to fit the faster pace of combat and the new gamepaly mechanics.
- Added several custom weapons, inspired by new and old concepts. These custom weapons were made to add new and more inventive ways to play your favorite classes
- Bots now equip items, will actively look out for armor (on higher difficulties) and have random difficulties, giving a more dynamic single-player experience.

Class changes:
- Run speeds have been increased across all 9 classes. However, one aspect remains: Heavies are the slowest, Scouts are the fastest.
- Source 2006-styled bunnyhopping is enabled. All classes have different bunnyhopping speed boosts, with Heavy having the lowest and Scout having the highest.
- Added increased air control to all classes. Each class has a different amount of air control.
- Armor has been added as an additional layer of damage resistance. How strong it is depends on the class. Armor can also be penetrated by backstabs, taunt kills, and headshots, and won't protect against bleed damage. Armor can be repaired by Dispensers, resupply cabinets, or by friendly Engineers hitting you with their wrench. Armor can also be picked up from Ammo crates.
	- If your Armor breaks, you'll be given mini-crits for 3 seconds to give you a chance to kill the responsible party. Medics with broken armor healing a teammate will share the mini crit bonus with their healing target. This bonus does NOT apply if your armor was broken through fall damage or self damage. When the bonus applies, you'll also be marked for death for 3.5 seconds.
	- Spies who are cloaked will not show the armor break effect when cloaked, but the sound will still play.

Custom Weapons:
- All Demoknight swords and shields have been truncated into the Charge Shield and the Sword.
	- The Charge Shield provides fast turning control, the ability to refill 35% of your charge through melee kills, the ability to jump (at the expense of 15% of your charge per jump) and increased armor durability at the expense of getting a slower armor repair rate from dispensers.
	- The Sword is similar to the Eyelander, but it offers a 20% damage bonus in return for 35% of both primary and secondary ammo, 15 less armor, and 40 less maximum health.
	- When both weapons are used, Demoknights have tougher armor and use a more powerful melee than stock in exchange for your secondary, a portion of your health and armor, and your grenade launcher's ammo supply. Due to the Sword's speed and health bonus, a Demoknight can gain up to 200 health, and run nearly as fast as a Scout.
	-  Alternative versions of the Sword are available, replicating the look of various versions of the Eyelander.
- Heavy gets a minigun to go alongside his regular one, known as the Artillery Cannon. It is fires powerful, accurate rounds at the expense of bullet count and fire rate.
- The Sniper has an alternative Sniper Rifle called the Railgun, allowing the Sniper to fire charged shots without zooming and penetrate through multiple targets at the expense of armor durability.
- The Engineer has an alternative PDA called the Valkyrie 3S, which increases your sentry turn rate in return for your buildings' maximum health.
- Heavy gets another minigun, called the Ludmila, which increases the Heavy's survivability in exchange for damage and minigun spinup time.
- The Soldier gets a melee that's a blast from the past, The Vitality Glitch, which increases the damage and move speed of the user when on low health, in return for damage, move speed, and armor durability.

Stock weapon balance changes:
- Random critical hits have been disabled. 
- Increased the default construction rate of all of Engineer's buildings by 20%.
- Default decloak time is now 1.5 seconds (originally 2.0 seconds).

Unlockable weapon balance changes:
- The Wrangler's shield has been disabled. Its sole function is now purely to control your sentry gun.
- The Shortstop's shove has a doubled pushback force (from 400 to 800).
- The Ullapool Caber's explosion radius was increased by 15%.
- The Ullapool Caber's explosion damage was increased by 35%.
- The Ullapool Caber now has a 45 second recharge.
- Added a taunt kill for the Ullapool Caber (The Show-and-Tell/Caber Swing).
- Increased the Jag's repair rate penalty from 20% to 33%
- Lowered the Gunslinger's max health bonus to 15 and added a 10 max armor bonus.
- The Gunslinger now has a 5% slower armor repair rate from dispensers.

MvM Changes:
- Added armor-related upgrades to MvM (max armor, pierces damage resistances, and armor resistance).
- Removed resistance upgrades from MvM and condenced them into the armor upgrade.
- Removed metal regen from MvM as it's useless.
- Replaced health regen in MvM with a max health boost.
